						Pa Elton, as he was popularly called, left his native country, England, to come to Ilesha, Nigeria in March 1937 in
						response to a divine call to be a missionary; his wife and only child, 3-year old Ruth, joining him about six months
						later. And since that time right up to his eventual home-call 50 years later, Pa Elton has always been at the centre
						of revival, playing one key role or the other. He had the opportunity of being part of the on-going revival at
						Ilesha (of the Joseph Ayo Babalola fame). He was also instrumental to the advent of the latter rain revival of the
						early 50's by providing an inroad for the revivalists to come into the country. In the wake of the evangelistic move
						of the 60's, he was also there, providing a platform for major international preachers and evangelists like Gordon
						Lindsay, T.L. Osborne and so many others including foreign missions that were willing to sponsor evangelistic work
						in Africa. He was thus a channel of financial provision for many indigenous missionaries and evangelists.

						The major emphasis of Pa Elton's vision and message was the Kingdom of God interfacing with human lives and
						societies and he taught this with vigour, bringing an erstwhile complacent church to begin to demand a righteous
						social order. Though a Briton by birth, Pa Elton was a complete Nigerian at heart and he undoubtedly provided
						accurate prophetic direction for the church and the nation, speaking profoundly about God's plan to use the nation
						to spearhead the last day revival.
					</p>
					<p>
						The greatest legacy of Elton however was his unparalleled commitment to the younger generation. A man of profound
						simplicity who insisted on building men rather than structures, Elton spent his latter years traversing all the
						campuses in the entire country then, ministering to students and teaching them the truths that provided the platform
						for the outbreak of the Pentecostal/charismatic revival of which the Church today is still reaping the fruits.
						Today, those young men and women he fathered then are themselves notable fathers in the body of Christ. His Ilesha
						home was open to all and sundry night and day and his exemplary servant-leader lifestyle still remains a high
						standard for present-day ministers.
					</p>
					<p>
						His only daughter also trailed her parents' steps by also becoming a full-time missionary to the middle belt region
						of Nigeria. The wife, Hannah, died in Nigeria in 1983 and Pa Elton also passed on 4 years later, having spent half a
						century on Nigerian soil, serving His Lord with his all. Both were buried in their Ilesha home.
